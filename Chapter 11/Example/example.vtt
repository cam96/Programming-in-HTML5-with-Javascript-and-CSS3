Hi guys, today I'm going to show you how to gut fish. Gutting fish is really important

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
if you go to prepare a whole fish. But also if you go to prepare a fillet of fish. Why?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
By gutting you remove the entrails and the parts that contaminate the fish flesh. So

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
first I put a fish on the cutting board. And with one hand I hold it firmly to avoid moving.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And I tip my knife into the point just in front of the rear fin and I cut it towards the head

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Now I move to the sink and I get rid of the guts of the fish with a little bit

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
of help of my knife. Nice and I'm cleaning under cold running water, and your fish is

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
done! So guys, really simple, insert your knife, cut all the way towards the head, spread

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
the belly, cut away the inside and clean the fish under cold running water.
